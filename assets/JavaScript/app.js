//create global variables 
//need a on submit function that submits answers 
//set time out to 30 seconds per questions (5 total minutes...is that too long?)

//set arrays for each questions with the possible answers
//---done in the html---\\
//create buttons (bootstrap or <button> in query) for the multiple choice answers 
//---done in the html---\\
//make sure they are only allowed to register one answer
//---done in the html---\\

//create a for loop that will traverse that array to compare the users choice to the correct answer
//separate array for the correct anwers? maybe use the [i] to see if user guess matches a certain [i]?
//---if there's time---create gif that appears on a correct guess and if time create a separate one for an incorrect guess
//append html (instructions div? somewhere at the bottom. maybe to replace the my-4) at the end with the nuber of correct guesses, incorrect guesses, and unanswered questions.
//create a button (new element?) with an onclick event that resets the questions, timer, and my-4 to the original text. 
//---someday - set up an API to bring in new questions? I'd have to rework all my html, but go back and do this after graduation---\\
